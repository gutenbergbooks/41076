<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Condemnation by a great poet has lasting impact,
while the effects of praise seldom endure; Shadwell remains
MacFlecknoe in our minds, Shaftesbury Achitophel, but
Anne Killigrew, "A <i>Grace</i> for Beauty, and a <i>Muse</i> for Wit,"
is virtually forgotten. Her book of verses is known essentially
because of John Dryden's commendatory Ode. Yet
we may justify a study of her own poems. Dryden's piece
is not a generalised encomium; obviously he had read her
verses, and his analysis of her art is firmly based.
Our understanding of this famous poem, then, depends to
some degree on our knowledge of Anne Killigrew's
output.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Her verses deserve attention on their own merits&mdash;Dryden
may well be thought more gallant than scrupulous,
but undeniably the poems have an appealing wit, a picturesque
imagination and a touching personal candour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The facts of Anne Killigrew's short life are succinctly
and elegantly related by Anthony Wood.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
She was born about 1660, the daughter of Dr. Henry Killigrew, Royalist,
theologian and sometime dramatist, and related through
his family to the other theatrical Killigrews&mdash;Thomas, the
author of <i>The Parson's Wedding</i>, and Sir William, her uncles;
and Thomas, the author of <i>Chit-Chat</i>, and Charles, Master of
the Revels, her cousins. Dr. Killigrew became Chaplain to
the Duke of York and in 1663 Master of the Savoy. Anne
Killigrew grew up to join the household of the doleful Mary
of Modena, Duchess of York, as Maid of Honour. A companion
in this office was Anne Finch, Countess of
Winchelsea. Mistress Killigrew's poems reflect some of the
sparkle of Restoration court life, but more of the sorrow
produced by Mary of Modena's consistent unpopularity.
After a short battle with the smallpox, Anne Killigrew died
on 16 June, 1685, to the "unspeakable Reluctancy" of her
many loving relations and friends.</p>

<p>After her untimely death, Dr. Killigrew worked to produce
a memorial edition of her papers, and invited Dryden
to write the prefatory poem. The publication was swift:
less than three months after her death the volume was
licensed to be printed (30 September, 1685) and listed in
the Stationers' Register (2 October). It was listed in the
Term Catalogue for November, and advertised in <i>The Observator</i>
on 2 November, 1685.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The date of 1686 on the
title page must have been anticipated by actual publication.</p>

<p>The poetry in the volume can be described in Dryden's
terms:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Art she had none, yet wanted none:</span>
<span class="i0">For Nature did that Want supply.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Anne Killigrew lacked the artistry which comes from discipline
and practice (which Anne Finch had time to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
develop), but she felt that the prompting of passion outweighed
the niceties of form:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here take no Care, take here no Care, my <i>Muse</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor ought of Art or Labour use....</span>
<span class="i0">The ruggeder my Measures run when read,</span>
<span class="i0">They'l livelier paint th' unequal Paths fond Mortals tread,
<a href="#Page_51">(p. 51)</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Her verses belong to the generalising conventions of
strong-minded Denham and limpid Waller:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such Noble Vigour did her Verse adorn,</span>
<span class="i0">That it seem'd borrow'd.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet to judge from her lively objections <a href="#Page_44">(pp. 44-47)</a>, the
attempt to class her as a plagiarist was unjustified. Court
poetry in the age was so uniform that apparent echoes are
a matter of course. We may compare her</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The bloody Wolf, the Wolf does not pursue;</span>
<span class="i0">The Boar, though fierce, his Tusk will not embrue</span>
<span class="i0">In his own Kind, Bares, not on Bares do prey:</span>
<span class="i0">Then art thou, Man, more savage far than they,
<a href="#Page_37">(p. 37)</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>with Rochester's <i>Satyr against Mankind</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Birds</i>, feed on <i>Birds</i>, <i>Beasts</i>, on each other prey,</span>
<span class="i0">But Savage <i>Man</i> alone, does <i>Man</i> betray,</span>
</div></div>

<p>or Waller on the death of Lady Rich, "But savage beasts,
or men as wild as they!" Anne Killigrew's use of stock
epithets and polite locutions mark a conventionality which
inevitably borders on the derivative. But at her best, as for
example "On the Birth-Day of Queen <i>Katherine</i>,"
 <a href="#Page_47">(p. 47)</a>, she
is able to move effectively beyond the conventional. The
conflict between the formal occasion and the dismal weather
becomes a surprising symbol of paradox, and the dream
and scriptural consolation come to have an intensity more
metaphysical than courtly. Similarly, in the unfinished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
"Ode," <a href="#Page_82">(p. 82)</a>, or in parts of the "Pastoral Dialogue,"
 <a href="#Page_63">(p. 63)</a>,
she produces some forceful and startling images.</p>

<p>The individuality of her works lies in their firm,
evangelical moral tone, which is clearly distinguishable
from the genteel piety of her contemporaries. Dryden's
comment:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So cold herself, whilst she such Warmth exprest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas <i>Cupid</i> bathing in <i>Diana's</i> Stream,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is an apt description of, say, her "Pastoral Dialogue,"
<a href="#Page_63">(pp. 63-75.)</a> Anne Killigrew's interest in poetic theory is notable;
her early "Alexandreis" prays for the "frozen style" to be
warmed with a "Poetique fire," and her "Love, the Soul
of Poetry," contrasts the flatness of commonplace verse with
the rapture and heat produced by a subject which "Enlarg'd
his Fancy, and set free his Muse." The poem "To My Lord
Colrane" meditates on her slothful muse and its awakening
of life. Throughout her writings she keeps the poet's
didactic end in view and has a high regard for the nature
of her art. Something of the severity of the York household
is reflected in the writings of the Maid of Honour.</p>

<p>The present text is reproduced, by kind permission,
from the beautiful copy in the Alexander Turnbull Library,
Wellington. This volume, originally in Dr. Philip Bliss's
collection, is listed in the <i>Huth Catalogue</i> (1913), p. 1207,
and described by W. C. Hazlitt, <i>Second Series of Bibliographical
Collections and Notes</i> (1882), p. 328. It contains
on the flyleaf a MS poem by E. E., transcribed below. The
Rev. Joseph Hunter, British Museum Add. MSS. 24492,
Vol. VI, p. 100, suggests that E. E. was Edmund Elys,
<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the
learned and contentious author of occasional poems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
(<i>Verses on Several Occasions</i>, 1699) and theological pamphlets
(for example, <i>Epistola ad Sam. Parkerum S.T.P.</i>,
1680). The generally vivacious style of the verse and the
reference to the debate with Dr. Parker suggest that the
identification is just, but the relationship between Mrs. Elys
and the Killigrews is not known. Pages 72 and 73 are
skipped, and pages 68 and 69 are misnumbered 60 and 61.</p>

<p>The self-portrait of Anne Killigrew prefixed to the
<i>Poems</i> and printed herein as the frontispiece shows that
she was a competent if conventional artist. Her descriptions
of her paintings, <a href="#Page_27">pp. 27-29</a>, suggest that here too
moral and scriptural topics predominated over courtly
affairs. E. E., Dryden and the writer of the Epitaph agree
on Anne Killigrew's sanctity and gravity of mind. The modern
reader may gain from her book of verse a moving
insight into the thoughts and preoccupations of a young
lady at court in the declining years of the Stuarts.</p>

<span class="i0">For proud he was, of an Ungovern'd Will,</span>
<span class="i0">With Love Familiar, but a Stranger still</span>
